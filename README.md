## A Web Application for personal budgeting

Built with React.JS, HTML, and CSS.

This app allows users to list as many incomes and expenses that they have on an occurence rate that they decide (weekly, monthly, yearly). 2 separate lists are then created and can be edited if they make an entry by mistake. Once the user is satisfied with both lists, they can use the "Crunch the numbers" button to give them the following metrics: 

- Net Income
- A standard savings rate (20% of Net Income)
- An aggressive savings rate (60%)
- A passive savings rate (10%)
